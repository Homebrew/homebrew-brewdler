## Requirements

[Homebrew](http://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) is used for installing the dependencies, it only works on OS X and so does this tool.

[brew tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/brew-tap.md) is new feature in Homebrew 0.9, adds more GitHub repos to the list of available formulae.

[Homebrew-cask](http://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) is optional and used for installing Mac applications.

## Install

You can install as a Homebrew tap:

    $ brew tap Homebrew/bundle

## Usage

Create a `Brewfile` in the root of your project:

    $ touch Brewfile

Then list your Homebrew based dependencies in your `Brewfile`:

    tap 'caskroom/cask'
    tap 'telemachus/brew', 'https://telemachus@bitbucket.org/telemachus/brew.git'
    brew 'emacs', args: ['with-cocoa', 'with-gnutls']
    brew 'redis'
    brew 'mongodb'
    brew 'sphinx'
    brew 'imagemagick'
    brew 'mysql'
    cask 'google-chrome'

You can then easily install all of the dependencies with one of the following commands:

    $ brew bundle

If a dependency is already installed and there is an update available it will be upgraded.

### Dump

You can create a `Brewfile` from all the existing Homebrew packages you have installed with:

    $ brew bundle dump

The `--force` option will allow an existing `Brewfile` to be overwritten as well.

### Cleanup

You can also use `Brewfile` as a whitelist. It's useful for maintainers/testers who regularly install lots of formulae. To uninstall all Homebrew formulae not listed in `Brewfile`:

    $ brew bundle cleanup

If `--dry-run` option is passed, bundle will list formulae rather than actually uninstalling them.

## Note

Homebrew does not support installing specific versions of a library, only the most recent one so there is no good mechanism for storing installed versions in a .lock file.

If your software needs specific versions then perhaps you'll want to look at using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) to better match your development and production environments.

(Or there is always MacPorts...)
