Bundler for non-ruby dependencies from homebrew

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/brewdler.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/brewdler)

## Requirements

[Homebrew](http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) is used for installing the dependencies, it only works on a mac and so does this gem.

[Homebrew-cask](http://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask) is optional and used for installing Mac applications.

## Usage

Install using rubygems:

    $ gem install brewdler

then create a `Brewfile` in the root of your project:

    $ touch Brewfile

Then list your homebrew based dependencies in your `Brewfile`:

    brew 'redis'
    brew 'mongodb'
    brew 'sphinx'
    brew 'imagemagick'
    brew 'mysql'
    cask 'google-chrome'

You can then easily install all of the dependencies on a new mac like so:

    $ brewdle install

## Note

Homebrew does not support installing specific versions of a library, only the most recent one so there is no good mechanism for storing installed versions in a .lock file.

If your software needs specific versions then perhaps you'll want to look at using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) to better match your development and production environments.

(Or there is always Macports...)

## Development

Source hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/andrew/brewdler).
Report Issues/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/andrew/brewdler/issues).

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
 * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
   (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
